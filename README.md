-- [Fontsninja](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fonts-ninja/eljapbgkmlngdpckoiiibecpemleclhh) and [Fardos Color Picker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/color-by-fardos-color-pic/iibpgpkhpfggipbacjfeijkloidhmiei) extension to fasten the work

> At first I used an extension called [Color Fly Picker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jjooglnnhopdfiiccjbkjdcpplgdkbmo) but I noticed a strange behavior in my browser, investigating further I noticed that it was malware.
